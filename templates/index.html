            <p class = "p-style">Coastal surveillance is an essential function to ensure the security of the littoral. Given the coastal areas to monitor and the nature of the environment, the Coast Guard faces maritime security challenges that we can overcome by deploying innovative technology. Identifying objects at sea is a complicated and tedious task with a probable low success rate given the size of the ocean and the nature of the different objects at sea. Unfortunately, this difficult task with a low identification rate is not representative of the duty of the coast guard. Coastal surveillance is a 24/7 duty with diverse demands ranging from search and rescue to potential threats. As a result, it is abstruse for humans to identify objects at sea. A possible solution is to deep neural network with capabilities to identify and process visual information. In this project, we will use powerful tools in imaging and video processing to empower the security and surveillance of the Coast Guard. The projectâ€™s scope is to identify objects at sea for the Coast Guard using their surveillance camera on drones. Using an appropriate deep learning identification tool, we will analyze the different object detection possibilities to develop high efficiency and high accuracy vessel detection. Deep learning in this case will help us solve this problem by detecting and localizing different types of objects at sea (fishing boats, houseboats, tankers, etc).</p>
            <p class = "p-style">The project aims to capture as much precise information as possible from the pictures. After a step of Exploratory Data Analysis, the study aims to perform a Clustering of the picture to isolate those that contain ships or other objects. Once these pictures containing ships are identified, the study aims to get more information about the ships, eventually predicting their category (Military, civil, fishing ships).
